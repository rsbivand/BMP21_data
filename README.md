# BMP21_data
Data and code for "A review of software for spatial econometrics in R", Bivand, Millo &amp; Piras

To replicate, `source("BMP_submission_0.R", echo=TRUE)` yields `script_output.Rout` and an active graphics device on-screen. 
Please update to the development version of **sphet** with `remotes::install_github("gpiras/sphet")` to reproduce the GMM output.
